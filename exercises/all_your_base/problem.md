To get into the rhythm, let's do a simple `hello world`.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

Write a Node program that accepts two command-line arguments, **X** and
Y and prints out to the console the following text:

  ALL YOUR `X` ARE BELONG TO `Y`

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

```sh
$ {appname} run program.js
```

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.js
```

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{appname}` again and select the next problem!
